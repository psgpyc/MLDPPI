#### Advanced Machine Learning Techniques

**Ensemble Methods:** Implement a combination of different machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machines, to create a more robust prediction model.

#### Risk Stratification and Personalized Interventions

**Risk Scoring System:** Create a novel risk scoring system based on your model's predictions, allowing for easy categorization of patients into different risk levels.

**Personalized Intervention Recommendations:** Develop an algorithm that suggests tailored interventions based on an individual's specific risk factors and health indicators

#### Real-world Application

**Web Application:** Develop a prototype mobile app that allows individuals to input their health indicators and receive a personalized diabetes risk assessment and intervention recommendations.

**Integration with Electronic Health Records:** Propose a framework for integrating your predictive model into existing electronic health record systems for real-time risk assessment in clinical settings
