# Machine Learning for Diabetes Prediction and Personalized Intervention

## Project Overview

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the onset of diabetes and identify risk factors for early intervention. It leverages the Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset to develop a comprehensive system for risk assessment and personalized health recommendations.

## Key Features

### 1. Advanced Machine Learning Models

- Ensemble methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)


### 2. Feature Engineering and Selection

- Novel feature creation
- Time-series analysis for longitudinal data

### 3. Model Interpretability

- SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values for feature importance
- Rule extraction from complex models

### 4. Risk Stratification

- Custom risk scoring system
- Categorization of patients into risk levels

### 5. Personalized Intervention Recommendations

- Tailored intervention suggestions based on individual risk factors
- Matching algorithm for risk profiles and interventions
- Priority ranking of recommendations


### 7. Validation and Benchmarking

- Comparison with established clinical guidelines

### 8. Real-world Application

- Prototype web application for risk assessment
**future**
- Framework for EHR (Electronic Health Record) integration

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing

- Handling missing values
- Feature scaling and normalization
- Encoding categorical variables

### Feature Selection

- Filter methods (correlation analysis, statistical tests)
- Wrapper methods (Recursive Feature Elimination)
- Embedded methods (Lasso, Random Forest importance)

### Model Development

- Training of various machine learning
- Hyperparameter tuning using techniques like grid search and random search
- Cross-validation for robust performance estimation

### Personalized Intervention Algorithm

1. Risk factor weighting
2. Intervention database creation
3. Matching algorithm development
4. Clustering for similar risk profiles
5. Rule-based system integration
6. Reinforcement learning for adaptive recommendations

### Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- ROC-AUC curve
- Confusion matrix

## Future Work

- Integration of real-time health data from wearable devices
- Expansion of the intervention database with latest medical research
- Collaboration with healthcare providers for clinical validation
- Uploading EHR to the web application
